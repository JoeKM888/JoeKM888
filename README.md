- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoeKM888
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything computers: games, programming, Facebook. I'm interested in music: I play bass guitar in a church worship band & I play several other instruments with varying degrees of success. I'm interested in anything sci-fi: games, movies, books. I'm interested in accessibility, I hope to specialise in accessibility cross platform development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IT. Doing a Bachelor of IT at RMIT in Melbourne Australia via remote learning (I'm in Sydney not Melbourne).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I'm not sure what I can do yet. I only have introductory Java skills in modern programming languages so far, in another couple of years I'll be familiar with more languages & able to contribute more. If you could use the help of a Java programmer with a very limited skillset please get in touch. If you feel like mentoring someone in coding for accessibility please get in touch.
